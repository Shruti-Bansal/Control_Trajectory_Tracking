# Control and Trajectory Tracking for Autonomous Vehicles
Udacity Self Driving nanodegree: Project 4 on Control Trajectory and Tracking

## Proportional-Integral-Derivative
Given a trajectory as an array of locations, and a simulation environment, you will design and code a PID controller to perform vehicle trajectory tracking and test its efficiency on the CARLA simulator used in the industry.
